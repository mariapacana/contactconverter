WIP Contact Converter

The Contact Converter (soon to be a gem) turns exported contact CSV files into
the Google Contacts format and merges together any duplicated contacts or
contact information. It supports the iCloud, CardScan, and SageAct formats.

I'm working on reaching 100% test coverage and on refining my algorithm for
detecting and flagging duplicates.
